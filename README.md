ðŸš€ Iâ€™m thrilled to launch my new personal project â€“ Nostra, a frontend-only e-commerce fashion replica website built using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS. Nostra is designed to give a complete online shopping experience with a multi-page structure including a stylish Home page and a functional Contact page. The Home page features a responsive navigation bar, an interactive popup menu for mobile users, a dynamic image slider with bold headlines, brand showcase logos, customer experience highlights, new arrivals, most-wanted collections with sale labels, an exclusive limited offer banner, and a newsletter subscription section. The Contact page includes a fully designed contact form with fields for name, email, phone number, and message, styled with modern Tailwind utilities for accessibility and responsiveness. A clean, reusable footer with social media icons ties everything together. ðŸŒŸ

This project helped me enhance my skills in responsive design, UI structuring, Tailwind integration, and reusable layouts, while also practicing custom CSS styling for better positioning and layout control. Itâ€™s a solid step toward building real-world e-commerce frontends and strengthening my frontend development journey.
